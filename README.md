## 🎭 What is CarrotKernel?

CarrotKernel is your **complete character consistency and lorebook management solution** for SillyTavern. While designed to work seamlessly with BunnyMoTags lorebooks and prompt engines, **you don't need BunnyMoTags to benefit** - the Template Manager, Injection System, and enhanced WorldInfo tracker work with any lorebook setup!

**The core magic:** Automatically detects character mentions in chat and injects their personality data into AI context at the perfect moment. Think of it as having a personal assistant who remembers every character detail and feeds it to your AI exactly when needed - ensuring consistent portrayal across all conversations.

> *"It's like having a character continuity editor who actually knows your lorebooks inside and out!"* 🎯

## 📖 How It Works

```
You type: "Alice walks into the room"
         ↓
CarrotKernel detects: "Alice"
         ↓
Scans lorebooks: Finds Alice's character archive
         ↓
Injects to AI: "<BunnymoTags><NAME:Alice>, <PERSONALITY:Tsundere>, <TRAIT:Shy></BunnymoTags>"
         ↓
AI responds: *Alice's face flushes red as she looks away* "I-It's not like I wanted to see you or anything!"
```

**Baby Bunny Mode Flow:**
```
AI generates: Character sheet with <BunnymoTags>
         ↓
Click carrot button: Baby Bunny popup appears
         ↓
Configure: Entry name, triggers, tags, lorebook, scope
         ↓
Create Archive: Character data saved to lorebook
         ↓
Auto-Activate: Lorebook enabled for character/chat/global
```
